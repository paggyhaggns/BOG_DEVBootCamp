            Hello! My name is Raghav Maddula, I am a first-year Computer Science major from Minnesota, and I am excited to improve my programming skills.
             In high school I participated in Boy Scouts, ultimately achieving the Eagle Scouts rank. On my road to Eagle Scouts,
              I was able to help my community with everything from conservation to teaching the next generations valuable skills.
               In my free time you can find me reading a book, spending time outside hiking and camping, or with my friends and family.
